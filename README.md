### The easy to use Minecraft Server panel.

EZServ started as a fun little project to assist in Minecraft server creation. Eventually I decided to fully develop it.

EZServ has features that easily let you manage and moderate your local Minecraft server, including a server installer, whitelisting, memory allocation, easy to read console with command input, controls such as start, restart, stop and forcestart, a easy to use server properties editor, and much more coming in the future.

### Beta Testing

If you would like to contribute to the project just grab the download and try it out. If you find any bugs, feel free to report them in the issues tab. If you have any ideas or would like to reach out for anything else, feel free to contact me on Discord at Mine#6197. I am eager to here a response from the community, and I am excited to finish this project.
