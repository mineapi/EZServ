### The easy to use Minecraft Server panel.

EZServ started as a fun little project to assist in Minecraft server creation. Eventually I decided to fully develop it.

EZServ has features that easily let you manage and moderate your local Minecraft server, including a server installer, whitelisting, memory allocation, easy to read console with command input, controls such as start, restart, stop and forcestart, a easy to use server properties editor, and much more coming in the future.

### Compiling

EZServ is an open-source project. You are free to modify and distribute this as long as you credit me as the original creator. You can take advantage of Apache Maven to compile EZServ. You can download it at https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi. Simply clone this repo into a folder and run mvn in the same directory using the following command line arguments:
```access transformers
mvn clean package
```

Maven should build the project into 2 files, one with just src code, and another with dependencies. You can use whichever one you prefer as long as you have the dependencies with you. Also note this program can be compile in Java 1.8 ***ONLY\!\!\!***

### Contribution

If you would like to contribute to the project just grab the download and try it out. If you find any bugs, feel free to report them in the issues tab. If you have any ideas or would like to reach out for anything else, feel free to contact me on Discord at Mine#6197. I am eager to here a response from the community, and I am excited to finish this project.
